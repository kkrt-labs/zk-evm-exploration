## zkSync 2.0

zk-Sync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to increase its transaction processing capacity. It allows for faster and cheaper transactions while preserving the privacy of transactions and data. The zk-EVM, a virtual machine built on top of zk-Sync, runs smart contracts and ensures their secure and verifiable execution. zk-Sync is aimed to address the scalability limitations of the Ethereum network, making it a promising solution for decentralized applications.

## How ZK EVM compiler work?
The zk-Sync zk-EVM compiler is responsible for compiling smart contracts written in high-level programming languages into a format that can be executed on the zk-EVM. The compiler takes the source code of a smart contract as input and produces machine-readable code in the form of bytecode that can be executed on the zk-EVM.

The compiler works by first converting the source code into LLVM intermediate representation (IR). This IR is then optimized for the target platform and architecture, which in the case of zk-Sync is the zk-EVM. The optimized IR is then translated into bytecode, which can be executed on the zk-EVM.

The bytecode produced by the compiler is then used to deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, where it can be executed by users and other smart contracts. The zk-EVM ensures that the execution of the smart contract is secure, transparent, and verifiable, using zero-knowledge proofs.

Overall, the zk-Sync zk-EVM compiler is a critical component of the zk-Sync platform, as it allows developers to write smart contracts in high-level programming languages and deploy them on the Ethereum blockchain, while ensuring their secure and verifiable execution on the zk-EVM.


## What is Zinc?

Zinc is a high-level programming language for smart contracts on zkSync. It's designed to make it easier for developers to write secure, efficient, and performant smart contracts on zkSync, by providing a more user-friendly syntax and a higher-level abstractions. With Zinc, developers can write smart contracts that are more readable and maintainable, without having to worry about low-level details of how the underlying zkSync technology works.
