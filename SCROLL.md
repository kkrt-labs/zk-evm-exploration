# Scroll

[Main documentation found at](https://guide.scroll.io/)

Scroll is a zkEVM-based zkRollup on Ethereum that enables native compatibility for existing Ethereum applications and tools.

The Scroll zkEVM is a **Type 2** zkEVM
Smart contracts are written in **Solidity**

The testnet is open, in "pre-alpha" stage. Their L1 and L2's RPC are a subdomain of scroll.io. The Pre-Alpha was released on 2022-07-19, after one year of building, and upgraded three months later on 2022-10-09

Consensus algorithm -> PoA Proof of Authority

## Backend language
Mainly Rust ðŸ¦€

The first commit was made on June 29th 2021, which coincides with what is said in the launch blog post ("After one year of working", the post was published on July 19th 2022).

The 3 co-founders are listed in the team section of the website. There are 17 people who did more than 10 commits on the repo, and 55 total contributors. The LinkedIn profile of Scroll lists 30 employees. Also, they follow 28 people on Twitter. Based on that info we can infer that there are 20Â±5 devs in a team of ~30.

As Scroll is Solidity powered zkEVM, generated opcode is classic Solidity opcode. No specificity there.

### Type of zk technology used for proving computation (SNARK, STARK, etc.)
SNARK

### Type of stack used for networking and consensus (single sequencer? single prover? open sourced?)
Single sequencer, single prover

### Date (if any) of production readiness
Sometime in 2023, according to their discord :
