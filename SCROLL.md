# Scroll zkEVM :

## Programming language to code the VM:
Rust ðŸ¦€

##  Type of zk technology used for proving computation (SNARK, STARK, etc.)

## zkEVM type
Currently, Scroll is a type 3 zkEVM but they aim for a type  2.

## How many people are approx. in the team
The 3 co-founders are listed in the team section of the website. There are 17 people who did more than 10 commits on the repo, and 55 total contributors.

##  Type of stack used for networking and consensus (single sequencer? single prover? open sourced?)

## Testnet ready? Open? Beta, Alpha? : 

The testnet is open, in "pre-alpha" stage. Their L1 and L2's RPC are a subdomain of scroll.io. The Pre-Alpha was released on 2022-07-19, after one year of building, and upgraded three months later on 2022-10-09
